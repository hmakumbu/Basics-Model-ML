#Building a Neural Network from Scratch

This repository includes sample usage scenarios and Python code for creating a basic neural network from scratch. This implementation of the neural network gives a rudimentary grasp of the inner workings of neural networks without requiring the usage of any external libraries.

## Overview

An essential idea in artificial intelligence and machine learning is neural networks. An instructional neural network implementation is available in this repository, which covers topics like activation functions, training loops, initialization of parameters, forward and backward propagation, and more.

## Features

- Building a neural network from scratch in Python 
- Showing how forward and backward propagation operate 
- Using a training loop to optimize network parameters 
- Using synthetic data as an example

## Dependencies

The code provided here requires the following dependencies:

- `numpy`: For numerical computations
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs

You can install these dependencies using pip and follow theses steps for runing:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hmakumbu/models_basics.git

# Navigate to the repository directory:
cd neural-network-from-scratch

# Run the example script:
python Neural_networks_from_scratch.py
